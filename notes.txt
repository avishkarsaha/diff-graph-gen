1. k doesnt move unless it has to
2. a lot of the time, k is useless as the edge probabilities do the job (i.e first_k doesnt
   shape the edge probs as they all fit within it easily)
3. what if input graph is not based on kNN?
4. start with knn and add positive and negative noise
5. what indications do we need on the toy problem that would convince us
   the model is working and will work on larger datasets? list all cases
6. model needs ability to create new edges rather than just removing current edges
